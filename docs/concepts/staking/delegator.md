# Delegator
---

In a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchain network, a delegator is a participant who delegates their tokens holdings to a staking pool to participate in the network's consensus process. Delegators do not validate transactions or create new blocks themselves, but they can participate in the network's consensus process by proxy through a pool.

Delegating tokens to a pool allows the delegator to participate in the network's consensus process and earn rewards for doing so, without having to run a pool node themselves. Delegators typically choose a pool based on their reputation, track record, and the rewards they offer.

Delegators are responsible for selecting a pool to delegate their tokens to and must be careful to choose a reputable and trustworthy one. Delegators can also switch pools at any time, which allows them to take advantage of new opportunities or switch to a different pool if their current pool is underperforming.

Delegators typically earn rewards for participating in the network's consensus process, which is shared between the delegators and the pool operator they delegate to. The exact amount of rewards earned may depend on various factors, such as the number of tokens staked, the length of time the tokens are staked for, and the network's overall performance.

Overall, delegation allows more participants to participate in the network's consensus process, which can help to increase the network's security and decentralization.
