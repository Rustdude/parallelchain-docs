# Validator
In a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchain network, a `validator` is a participant in the network who is responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks. Validators are selected based on the amount of tokens they hold and their **stake** in the network. This stake serves as collateral and incentivizes validators to act honestly and maintain the security of the network.

Validators in a DPoS network are responsible for two key functions: proposing new blocks and validating transactions. Validators propose new blocks by creating a block with a set of new transactions and adding it to the blockchain. To validate transactions, validators must check that the transaction is valid, that the sender has enough tokens to complete the transaction, and that the transaction is not a double spend.

Validators in a DPoS network are chosen according to the amount they staked in the network. The more tokens a user stakes, the greater their chances of being selected to be one of the validators in the next epoch.
