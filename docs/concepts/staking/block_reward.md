## Block reward

Block rewards in blockchain are a form of incentive that is given to validators who participate in the process of adding new blocks to a blockchain network. The process of adding new blocks to a blockchain is known as validating in delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchains.


In DPoS blockchains, validators are chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of XPLL they have staked in the network. Validators are rewarded with a portion of the transaction fees and a portion of the block rewards for creating new blocks.


Block rewards serve several purposes in blockchain networks. They incentivize miners and validators to participate in the network's consensus process, which helps to maintain the security and integrity of the network. Block rewards also provide a way to introduce new XPLL into circulation, which helps to ensure that the network is sustainable in the long term.


Over time, the block reward amount decreases as more blocks are added to the blockchain. This is known as the block reward halving, and it is a feature of many blockchain networks, including Bitcoin. The block reward halving helps to control the supply of cryptocurrency and prevent inflation.
