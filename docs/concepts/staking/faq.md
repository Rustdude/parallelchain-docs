## FAQ

#### Why am I not able to stake XPLL tokens?
You will need to retain a certain amount of XPLL in your account balance to pay for transaction fees. Ensure that you have reserved a small amount of XPLL tokens to pay for the gas fee of your deposit, stake, or unstake XPLL tokens.

---

#### How do I know which validator to stake with?
The validators securing the ParallelChain Mainnet are trusted participants who are required to stake a significant number of XPLL. You may check the yield and commission fee of each validator by tapping on the drop-down arrow of the ‘Operator’ field.

---

#### How long is the unstaking period?
The staking duration is measured by epochs. If you stake and unstake within the same epoch, the waiting time is considerably shorter. If the staking and unstaking are not within the same epoch, you will need to wait for at least another two epochs before unstaking.

---

#### How long is an Epoch?
One full epoch lasts approximately one day before it enters the next epoch. The epoch itself is a protocol-defined period for measuring the performance of operators on the network.

---

#### How do I withdraw my staking rewards?
You can withdraw the rewards you have earned from staking by unstaking them to your Token Deposit. Additionally, you may toggle the ‘AUTO STAKE REWARDS’ to avoid the process of unstaking your rewards. From there, you can then withdraw the amount to your wallet. Please refer to the section on Unstaking Your XPLL and Withdrawing Your Staking Rewards for the required steps.

---

#### Can I move my staked XPLL to another validator?
Yes, you can. You will need to unstake your XPLL tokens, withdraw them to the Token Deposit, then back to your wallet. You can then transfer those tokens to a Token Deposit with another validator before staking your tokens with them. Please refer to the sections above to move your XPLL to another validator.

---

#### Can I stake to more than one node?
Yes, you can. To do so, you will need to create a Token Deposit on the validator node you wish to stake with. Once done, you can stake tokens with the validator node. To stake XPLL with more than one validator, repeat the same process of creating a Token Deposit with the other validator node, deposit tokens from your account to the Token Deposit, and you can stake with the second validator. Repeat this process with other validator nodes you wish to stake with.

---

#### The status is still showing ‘PENDING’. Why is my transaction not confirmed yet?
Transactions are prioritized by the amount of Priority Fee per Gas paid, and lower priority transactions may need more time to be confirmed. You may choose to pay a higher Priority Fee during peak periods for a faster transaction, or you may check your wallet address on the blockchain explorer to monitor its transaction status.

---

#### Are the rewards automatically staked?
Depends on the setting of your stake. Your staking rewards will not be automatically staked unless the **AUTO STAKE REWARDS** field is toggled on. You can toggle it on or off anytime you want.

---

#### Is there any locking period?
There is no locking period to stake your XPLL tokens, but the staking duration is measured by epochs. If you stake and unstake within the same epoch, the waiting time is considerably shorter. If the staking and unstaking are not within the same epoch, you will need to wait at least for another two epochs before unstaking.
