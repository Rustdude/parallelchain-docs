# What is XPLL
---
**XPLL** is the native cryptocurrency of ParallelChain Mainnet (**TXPLL** in Testnet). The users of the ParallelChain Mainnet need XPLLs to pay for their transaction fees when using the network. The transaction fee is denoted in GRAY, the smallest unit of XPLL, where 1 GRAY = 0.00000001 XPLL. Other than that, XPLL also plays an important role in this Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Mainnet; it incentivizes good behaviors and punishes actions that threaten the network's security, availability, and user experience.

For more information about XPLL, including allocations, circulation, and inflation, please refer to the [XPLL Token Metrics](https://parallelchain.io/parallelchain/mainnet/papers/xpll-metrics).
