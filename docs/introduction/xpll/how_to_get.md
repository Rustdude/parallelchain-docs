# How to Get XPLL

There are several ways to obtain XPLLs, the native tokens of ParallelChain.

## Staking Rewards
---
Users can stake XPLL with the network validators to help secure the blockchain and earn rewards in the meantime. Staking is a process of locking up a certain amount of XPLL for a period of time in the process of validating transactions, adding new blocks, etc. Therefore, users will be rewarded with additional XPLL for contributing to the security and integrity of the network.

To learn more about staking, read [Staking](../../concepts/staking/what_is_staking.md).



## Ecosystem Activities - Ambassador Programme
----
Users can earn XPLL by participating in our **Ambassador Programme** on [Zealy.io](https://zealy.io/c/parallelchain/questboard). There are a variety of tasks and missions for community members to complete. In return, community members will receive rewards, perks, and badges by leveling up on Zealy. This is an opportunity for community members to earn XPLLs while keeping everyone engaged.
