# What is ParallelChain

**ParallelChain** is a dual-blockchain ecosystem powered by two Layer-1 blockchain networks, **ParallelChain Mainnet** and **ParallelChain Enterprise**.

ParallelChain Mainnet is a **Delegated Proof-of-Stake** open-source platform that is suitable for building decentralised, web2 and web3-interoperable blockchain applications; and ParallelChain Enterprise is a business-native, permissioned blockchain that supports decentralised enterprise solutions that feature stronger privacy, scalability, and compliance features. The coupling of both blockchains in a permissioned-permissionless blockchain interoperability will bring Web2 and Web3 into a scalable, networked economy.

The continued development of ParallelChain is supported by the **ParallelChain Foundation**, an independent governance body based in Switzerland, and it is dedicated to increasing awareness and growing a strong builder community for ParallelChain.
