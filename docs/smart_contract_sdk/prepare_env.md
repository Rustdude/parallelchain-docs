# Prepare Environment

In this section, you need the tools and environment to develop and run smart contracts. You can utilize our Mainnet to deploy and make contract calls. You may consider testing your transaction on Testnet before doing it on Mainnet.

## Checking the Network
---

You can check the **mainnet** network by viewing the Explorer website:

* [ParallelChain Mainnet Explorer](https://explorer.parallelchain.io/explorer) 

The explorer can explore transactions, addresses, information about the network, and blocks.

To verify that **testnet node** is alive:

* [https://pchain-test-rpc02.parallelchain.io](https://pchain-test-rpc02.parallelchain.io)

You can use ParallelChain Client (called `pchain_client`) to interact with the `testnet` node.

## Setup ParallelChain Client 
---
Before we start developing the smart contracts, the `pchain_client` executable needs to be configured.

If you are not yet familiar with `pchain_client`, See [Getting Started](../getting_started/installation.md) to install `pchain_client` and learn about basic functionalities before proceeding with smart contract development.
